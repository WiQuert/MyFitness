Hey there! 

This project is my training in android development in general and kotlin in particular. I was learning from the Neco project (https://www.youtube.com/@NecoRuChannel), but I tried to refine it and make changes. 
In the future I will definitely improve and make even cooler independent projects.

Thank you for watching!
